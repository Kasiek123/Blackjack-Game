<h1 style="bold">Blackjack</h1>

<p align="justify">
  The idea of our project is to create a program that will allow the user to play the game of Blackjack. 
The main goal of the game is to get the sum of points as close as possible or equal to the value of 21.
It is important that this number is not exceeded, as this causes an automatic loss of the player in question. 
If during the game one of the players scores 21 points, then he completes the "blackjack", which means his 
automatic win (even at the very beginning of the game).
However, in the case of the same score (even 21 points by both), the game ends in a draw.
